# pizzaDudeSite

// This is a test website to work on my frontend development skills
// I googled random pizza company names & PizzaDude was on there
// The main goal of this project was to start with a wireframe & work up to a finalized website
// I've worked on a few webistes before but this is the first where I had a plan & I saw it from start to finish
// This project was a good learning experience with CSS & Flexbox - Having a wireframe it forced me to try & get the elements exactly where I wanted them
